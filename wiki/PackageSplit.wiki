=== GUI plugin development ===
  # eclipse IDE menu and toolbar entry : _Import grammar_
  # option to import a BNF grammar specification (intermediate language - tbd) from file system or from an URL

=== Grammar development ===
  # define simple xtext syntax for one type of vocabulary. Example (foaf with minimal elements - still a draft):

{{{

  # define meta data vocabulary intermediate syntax: usually vocabularies are presented in human readable form. We have to represent them in machine readable form: csv, xml, or whatever format that can be easily parsed and transformed to EBNF, in order to generate the editor code
  # write a few vocabularies in intermediate syntax (foaf, doap, dcmi...)
  # implement component which takes as input the intermediate meta data vocabulary representation (defined at point 2) and outputs the EBNF grammar

=== Web Service Development ===
  # investigate how to create and use a REST web service
  # create a few web services (possibly different languages - C#, Java, Ruby...) that expose meta data vocabulary description

=== Documentation ===
  # eclipse
  # xtext
  # DSL development with eclipse
  # EMF, GEF, GMF ...

=== Model to Model transformations, dynamic EBNF usage, work flow extension ===
  * thinking...
